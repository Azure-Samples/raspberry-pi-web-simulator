## How to register an IoT hub
Click [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-web-simulator-get-started) and follow it to create your own IoT hub

## Usage
- Replace the connection string with your Azure IoT hub device connection string, and click `run` button or type `npm start` in the console to run a client application to

    - send message to IoT hub
    - receive C2D message from IoT hub
    - receive device method from IoT hub

- While the sample code running, you can see

    - the LED is blinking in the left part
    - some message is printed in the console
    
- To expand the code editor, you can fold the console

- Write your own piece of code in the code editor and run

## Contribution Guide
**Notice!** Only `source` branch is for source code. `master` and `static-int` branch are generated by build service. So never manually update these branches.

### For common scenario
- Create a new branch based on `source` branch.
- Create a Pull Request.
- Merge with `source` branch with at least one approval. **Do not merge with git tags**
- Wait for 5 minutes and check your change on [test site](http://raspberry-pi-simulator.azurewebsites.net)

### For production deployement scenario
- Before doing following steps, make sure all changes are tested on test site.
- Create a tag with `git tag` command. Better name the tag as version number.
- Use `git push --tags` command to push tag on `source` branch.
- Wait for 5 minutes and check your change on [prod site](https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/)
